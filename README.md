Installation
============
**Note to self**: I'm currently using Neovim, so make sure to create the appropriate symbolic links (`.vimrc` to `.nvimrc` & `.vim` to `.nvim`). Some plugins might be optimized for Neovim, so proceed with caution and check `.vimrc` before doing anything!

1. If you don't have it already, install [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick);
2. Clone this repo: `homesick clone pcalves/dotfiles`;
3. Symlink contents: `homesick symlink dotfiles`;
4. Isntall `homebrew` and use your `Brewfile` ([https://robots.thoughtbot.com/brewfile-a-gemfile-but-for-homebrew](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/brewfile-a-gemfile-but-for-homebrew))
4. Download & install [Plug.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
5. Install Vim plugins: `:PlugInstall`;
